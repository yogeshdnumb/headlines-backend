And much of its effort hinges on rebuilding Siri from the ground up.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Gurman has reported in the past that <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/21/24302685/apple-llm-siri-compete-chatgpt\">Apple is working on</a> what it’s internally calling “LLM Siri” — a reworked, generative AI version of the company’s digital assistant. Apple’s previous approach of merging the assistant with the existing Siri hasn’t been working. Gurman describes in great detail a number of reasons why, but here’s a quick summary:</p>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Apple software chief Craig Federighi was “reluctant to make large investments in AI.”</strong> The company doesn’t like to invest in a goal without a clear endpoint, Gurman writes, but where AI is concerned, one unnamed Apple executive told him “…you really don’t know what the product is until you’ve done the investment.” That would have meant expensive GPUs, which the company didn’t rush to buy and later didn’t have enough of to keep up with competitors.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Apple started late<em>. </em></strong>Another executive told Gurman that Apple Intelligence “wasn’t even an idea” before ChatGPT launched in late 2022.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Apple AI chief John Giannandrea thought people didn’t want AI chatbots. </strong>He told employees that customers commonly want to be able to disable tools like ChatGPT.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Old Siri didn’t work with new Siri. </strong>Apple apparently saw bolting generative AI features onto the old Siri as the fastest way to catch Apple up in AI, but it wasn’t working. “It’s whack-a-mole. You fix one issue, and three more crop up,” an employee told Gurman.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Giannandrea didn’t “fit in” with Apple’s inner circle.</strong> Giannandrea was a rare outside executive hire when he <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/3/17195076/google-ai-chief-john-giannandrea-joining-apple-machine-learning-siri\">came on in 2018</a>, and he didn’t have the same “forceful” personality as others in company leadership. He didn’t fight hard enough to get big funding amounts, the report says. Apple employees told Gurman that Giannandrea didn’t push his workers hard enough, and that he doesn’t see big AI companies like OpenAI or Google as an urgent threat to Apple.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Marketing got out over its skis.<em> </em></strong>The company’s AI marketing focused heavily on promised features like an improved Siri or Apple Intelligence being able to take context from apps across your system before they were ready — features that it has since <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/629940/apple-siri-robby-walker-delayed-ai-features\">been forced to delay</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now the company is trying to rejigger its approach. Part of that is a total overhaul of Siri, rather than just trying to make generative AI work in concert with the old Siri. According to Gurman, Apple has its AI team in Zurich working on a new architecture that will “entirely build on an LLM-based engine.” Gurman reported in November last year that the company was working on this, and the idea is that it will make the assistant “more believably conversational and better at synthesizing information.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Another part of the solution is <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/648496/apple-improve-ai-models-differential-privacy\">leveraging iPhones</a> and differential privacy to improve Apple’s synthesized data — comparing fake training data with language from iPhone users’ emails, but doing so on-device and sending only the synthesized data back to Apple for AI training. And one way the company is discussing improving Siri is letting the LLM version loose on the web to “grab and synthesize data from multiple sources.” Basically, Siri as an AI web search tool not unlike Perplexity, which is one of the companies Apple has approached about partnering for AI search in Safari.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Whatever the outcome, apparently Giannandrea won’t be a direct part of it, having been taken off of product development, Siri, and robotics projects in the spring.

Below, we’ve listed the best deals you can get on each iPad model that is available, from the 10th-gen iPad of 2022 to the more powerful iPad models with M3 and M4 chips.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"CM2y8j\">The best <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23418039/apple-ipad-review-10th-gen-2022-10-9-tablet-ipados\">iPad (2022)</a> deals</h2>\n\n<p>Apple’s <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23418039/apple-ipad-review-10th-gen-2022-10-9-tablet-ipados\"><strong>10th-gen iPad</strong></a> came out in late 2022. It’s still a great tablet overall; however, it’s recently been supplanted by <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/621625/apple-ipad-2024-launch-price-availability\">Apple’s latest entry-level model</a>, which features an upgraded A16 chip and twice as much base storage. That said, the last-gen iPad still benefits from a modern design and Apple’s long-in-the-making switch to USB-C. The 10.9-inch tablet is also outfitted with a side power button with a fingerprint sensor and uniform bezels, though, unlike its predecessor, it lacks a home button and a 3.5mm headphone jack.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, the base model with 64GB of storage is on sale at <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/2022-Apple-10-9-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi-64GB-Blue-10th-Generation/1924288816\">Walmart</a> starting at $299 ($50 off), which is $40 more than its best price to date. <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/2022-Apple-10-9-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi-64GB-Blue-10th-Generation/1497747190\">Walmart</a> are also selling the 256GB model with Wi-Fi in select colors for just shy of $350 ($150 off), which is a better deal when you consider you can currently grab an 11th-gen iPad with an expanded 128GB of storage at Amazon <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-iPad-11-inch-Display/dp/B0DZ77D5HL/\">starting at $299</a> ($100 off).</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"the-best-ipad-2025-deals\">The best <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/apple/636335/ipad-2025-11th-generation-review\">iPad (2025)</a> deals</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As noted above, <strong>Apple’s 11th-gen iPad</strong> just recently landed on the scene. The <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/621625/apple-ipad-2024-launch-price-availability\">new base-model tablet</a> is a fairly iterative update of the prior model with 128GB of base storage (as opposed to 64GB) and an A16 Bionic chip, which is nearly 30 percent faster than the A14 chip found in the 10th-gen iPad. The newer chip doesn’t support the various Apple Intelligence features introduced in iPadOS 18.1. For that, you’ll want to opt for a more recent iPad Air, iPad Mini, or iPad Pro model.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Pricing-wise, the new iPad starts at $349 with Wi-Fi and 128GB of storage. You can also upgrade to 256GB or 512GB of storage for an additional $100 or $200, respectively, or purchase an LTE model starting at $499. We haven’t seen significant price drops yet, though the entry-level model is on sale at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Display-All-Day/dp/B0DZ77D5HL/\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/2025-Apple-11-inch-iPad-A16-Built-for-Apple-Intelligence-Wi-Fi-128GB-Silver/15483805722\">Walmart</a> starting at $299 ($50 off) right now. Alternatively, you can grab the 256GB model at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Display-All-Day/dp/B0DZ773FRV/\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1883629-REG/apple_md4g4ll_a_11_ipad_a16_chip.html\">B&amp;H Photo</a> starting at $399 ($50 off), or the 512GB variant at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Display-All-Day/dp/B0DZ77RHLL/\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/2025-Apple-11-inch-iPad-A16-Built-for-Apple-Intelligence-Wi-Fi-128GB-Blue/15437600985\">Walmart</a> starting at $594.95 ($54 off).</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"njqbEo\">The best <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/22/24275956/apple-ipad-mini-2024-review\">iPad Mini (2024)</a> deals</h2>\n\n<p>The new <strong>seventh-gen iPad Mini</strong> is similar to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22696652/ipad-mini-2021-6th-gen-review\">the outgoing model</a> but comes with faster Wi-Fi and USB-C speeds, support for the Apple Pencil Pro, and a newer A17 Pro processor with 8GB of RAM to support Apple Intelligence. Otherwise, it boasts nearly identical specs and features as the last-gen model, meaning it has an 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display, a USB-C port, and options for 5G. It may not be worth upgrading if you already own a sixth-gen Mini, but newcomers to the category will appreciate the upgrades.</p>\n\n<p>The 2024 iPad Mini starts at $499 with 128GB of storage, which was the price for the previous generation’s 64GB model. Electing for 256GB of storage brings the price up to $599, and the cellular models start at $649. These are some big numbers for a small iPad, and the larger iPad Air might be worth considering&nbsp;if you prefer your dollar to go further with more screen real estate. But if you want an Apple tablet in the smallest possible form factor, this is where the action is.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, the 128GB base model with Wi-Fi is only on sale at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK3W6TV6/\">Amazon</a> for $474, which is a mere $15 discount. You can also pick up the 256GB variant at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK3XM94S/\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1858552-REG/apple_mxna3ll_a_ipad_mini_wi_fi_256gb.html\">B&amp;H Photo</a> for $589 ($10 off), or the 512GB model at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK3XT3DX/\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1858564-REG/apple_mygy3ll_a_ipad_mini_wi_fi_512gb.html/\">B&amp;H Photo</a> for $699 ($100 off), the latter of which is best price we’ve seen on the largest storage configuration.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"the-best-ipad-air-2024-deals\">The <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/ipad/626647/apple-ipad-air-review-2025\">best iPad Air (2025)</a> deals</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The <strong>2025 iPad Air</strong> is little more than a spec bump over the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24155407/apple-ipad-air-review-2024\">previous model</a>, with a few technical upgrades that should allow it to last longer than both the entry-level iPad and the last-gen Air. It features an M3 chip with support for Apple Intelligence and compatibility with Apple’s latest Magic Keyboard, which has a larger trackpad and an extra row of function keys that make the Air a more credible laptop replacement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The 11-inch model starts at $599 and the 13-inch variant $799 — the same price as the previous models — but we’re already starting to see discounts from third-party retailers. Right now, for instance, the 11-inch Air is on sale at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-11-inch-Intelligence-Display-All-Day/dp/B0DZ76BN5D/\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1883562-REG/apple_mc9x4ll_a_11_ipad_air_m3.html\">B&amp;H Photo</a> in its base configuration with Wi-Fi and 128GB of storage starting at $529 ($20 off).

The 11- and 13-inch models start at $999 and $1,299, respectively, and they were the first Apple devices to feature the company’s latest <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24148451/apple-m4-chip-ai-ipad-macbook\">M4 chip</a>, which brings moderate performance gains and dedicated hardware for on-device Apple Intelligence processing. The new Pro models can claim other firsts, too, such as being the first iPad models with OLED displays and the lightest Pros yet, which is true of both sizes. They also feature repositioned front-facing cameras that sit along the horizontal edge, which prevent you from looking as though you’re staring off into space on a video call.</p>\n\n<p>As for deals, the 11-inch iPad Pro with Wi-Fi / 256GB of storage is currently on sale at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3J9XDMQ/\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1826767-REG/apple_mvv83ll_a_11_ipad_pro_wifi.html\">B&amp;H Photo</a> starting at $899 ($100 off) — which is about $20 more than its typical sale price. The sleek and super-thin 13-inch model, meanwhile, is on sale in its 256GB base configuration at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3J98W75/\">Amazon</a> starting at $1,186.99 ($112 off), which is nearly $90 shy of the tablet’s all-time low.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","contentSnippet":"Apple’s latest entry-level iPad is down to $299 for a limited time. | Photo: Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nWhile the best iPad deals usually land during major sale events like Black Friday and Prime Day, many great iPad deals are attainable outside of those times.

It may not be worth upgrading if you already own a sixth-gen Mini, but newcomers to the category will appreciate the upgrades.\nThe 2024 iPad Mini starts at $499 with 128GB of storage, which was the price for the previous generation’s 64GB model. Electing for 256GB of storage brings the price up to $599, and the cellular models start at $649. These are some big numbers for a small iPad, and the larger iPad Air might be worth considering if you prefer your dollar to go further with more screen real estate. But if you want an Apple tablet in the smallest possible form factor, this is where the action is.\nRight now, the 128GB base model with Wi-Fi is only on sale at Amazon for $474, which is a mere $15 discount. You can also pick up the 256GB variant at Amazon and B&H Photo for $589 ($10 off), or the 512GB model at Amazon and B&H Photo for $699 ($100 off), the latter of which is best price we’ve seen on the largest storage configuration.\nThe best iPad Air (2025) deals\nThe 2025 iPad Air is little more than a spec bump over the previous model, with a few technical upgrades that should allow it to last longer than both the entry-level iPad and the last-gen Air. It features an M3 chip with support for Apple Intelligence and compatibility with Apple’s latest Magic Keyboard, which has a larger trackpad and an extra row of function keys that make the Air a more credible laptop replacement.\nThe 11-inch model starts at $599 and the 13-inch variant $799 — the same price as the previous models — but we’re already starting to see discounts from third-party retailers. Right now, for instance, the 11-inch Air is on sale at Amazon and B&H Photo in its base configuration with Wi-Fi and 128GB of storage starting at $529 ($20 off). You can also grab the 256GB model at Amazon and B&H Photo for $599 ($100 off), or the step-up 512GB model at Amazon for $827 ($72 off).\nThe larger 13-inch model, meanwhile, is on sale at Amazon and B&H Photo with 128GB of storage starting at $699 ($100 off). You can also pick up the Wi-Fi / 256GB model at Amazon starting at $826 ($73 off), or the 512GB variant at Amazon and B&H Photo starting at $1,009 ($90 off), which nearly matches the lowest price we’ve seen on the larger storage configuration.\nThe best iPad Pro (2024) deals\nThe 2024 iPad Pro is a far more impressive upgrade than the latest iPad Air. The 11- and 13-inch models start at $999 and $1,299, respectively, and they were the first Apple devices to feature the company’s latest M4 chip, which brings moderate performance gains and dedicated hardware for on-device Apple Intelligence processing. The new Pro models can claim other firsts, too, such as being the first iPad models with OLED displays and the lightest Pros yet, which is true of both sizes. They also feature repositioned front-facing cameras that sit along the horizontal edge, which prevent you from looking as though you’re staring off into space on a video call.\nAs for deals, the 11-inch iPad Pro with Wi-Fi / 256GB of storage is currently on sale at Amazon and B&H Photo starting at $899 ($100 off) — which is about $20 more than its typical sale price. The sleek and super-thin 13-inch model, meanwhile, is on sale in its 256GB base configuration at Amazon starting at $1,186.99 ($112 off), which is nearly $90 shy of the tablet’s all-time low.","summary":"While the best iPad deals usually land during major sale events like Black Friday and Prime Day,&#160;many great iPad deals are attainable outside of those times.
