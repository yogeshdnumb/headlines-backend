The latest Kindle — which starts at $109.99 — boasts a brighter 94-nit display, improved contrast levels, and slightly faster page turns. It also comes in a “matcha” green instead of “denim,” just in case you’re not a fan of the default black color. Otherwise, though, it’s nearly identical to its predecessor, with the same six-inch 300ppi screen, support for USB-C, and 16GB of base storage.</p>\n\n<p>In the past, Amazon’s newest ad-supported Kindle has dropped to as low as $84.99 ($25 off) with three months of Kindle Unlimited. Right now, however, you can only buy the base Kindle at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CNV9F72P\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/amazon-kindle-16-gb-2024-black/6599466.p\">Best Buy</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.target.com/p/amazon-kindle-6-e-reader-2024/-/A-93604795?preselect=91563144#lnk=sametab\">Target</a> for its full retail price of $109.99.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Hgsv5D\">The best Kindle Kids (2024) deals</h2>\n\n<p>Amazon also updated its kid-friendly Kindle in late 2024. The new Kindle Kids is identical to the standard model but comes with several accessories and provides age-appropriate content for younger readers who prefer digital books. Like the last-gen Kindle Kids, the latest model retails for $20 more than the base model, bringing the MSRP to $129.99.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of add-ons, the new Kindle Kids edition consists of four items: the device, a protective case, a two-year extended replacement guarantee (in the event the device breaks), and six months of Amazon Kids Plus. The last feature is the biggest selling point of the device aside from the kid-friendly patterns and lack of ads, as it allows parents to grant their child access to games, videos, and books — including those in the&nbsp;<em>Percy Jackson</em> and&nbsp;<em>Harry Potter</em>&nbsp;series — at no additional cost.</p>\n\n<p>In the past, we’ve seen the latest Kindle Kids sell for as low as $94.99 ($35 off).

Typically, you save about $20 by buying the ad-supported version, but if you decide to remove ads later, you can make a one-time payment to cover the difference and remove the ads.\nIn case you missed it, Amazon announced a new entry-level Kindle in October, one that was designed to replace the outgoing 2022 model. The latest Kindle — which starts at $109.99 — boasts a brighter 94-nit display, improved contrast levels, and slightly faster page turns. It also comes in a “matcha” green instead of “denim,” just in case you’re not a fan of the default black color. Otherwise, though, it’s nearly identical to its predecessor, with the same six-inch 300ppi screen, support for USB-C, and 16GB of base storage.\nIn the past, Amazon’s newest ad-supported Kindle has dropped to as low as $84.99 ($25 off) with three months of Kindle Unlimited. Right now, however, you can only buy the base Kindle at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target for its full retail price of $109.99. \nThe best Kindle Kids (2024) deals\nAmazon also updated its kid-friendly Kindle in late 2024. The new Kindle Kids is identical to the standard model but comes with several accessories and provides age-appropriate content for younger readers who prefer digital books. Like the last-gen Kindle Kids, the latest model retails for $20 more than the base model, bringing the MSRP to $129.99.\nIn terms of add-ons, the new Kindle Kids edition consists of four items: the device, a protective case, a two-year extended replacement guarantee (in the event the device breaks), and six months of Amazon Kids Plus. The last feature is the biggest selling point of the device aside from the kid-friendly patterns and lack of ads, as it allows parents to grant their child access to games, videos, and books — including those in the Percy Jackson and Harry Potter series — at no additional cost.\nIn the past, we’ve seen the latest Kindle Kids sell for as low as $94.99 ($35 off). Right now, however, you can only pick it up at Amazon and Target for $104.99 ($25 off), which remains the e-reader’s second-best price to date.\nThe best Kindle Paperwhite (2024) deals\nThe latest Kindle Paperwhite, which launched last year, is Amazon’s 12th-gen model. Considering it’s one of the company’s higher-end configurations, it offers all the features found in the entry-level Kindle, including USB-C charging and a crisp 300ppi display. It’s noticeably faster than Amazon’s base ebook reader and features IPX8 waterproofing, a larger seven-inch display, and longer battery life.\nIn the past, we’ve seen the standard Paperwhite drop to as low as $129.99. Unfortunately, the standalone model is currently only available at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target starting at $159.99 (its full retail price). If you’re okay with purchasing a bundle, though, you can grab it at Amazon with a power adapter and either a green, pink, or black fabric cover for $196.97 ($20 off); it’s also available at Amazon with a plant-based leather cover in green, pink, or black for $202.97 (also $20 off).\nRead our Kindle Paperwhite (2024) review.\nLike other Kindles, the new Paperwhite is available in a few different configurations — including an ad-free Signature Edition that’s identical to the standard model but comes with 32GB of storage, Qi wireless charging, and a backlight that will automatically adjust when needed. It’s only available at Amazon and Best Buy right now for its typical retail price of $199.99, though you can pick it up at Amazon with a wireless charging dock and a black, green, or pink fabric cover starting at $251.97 ($25 off). It’s also available at Amazon with a plant-based leather cover in black, green, or pink for $257.97 ($25 off).\nThe best Kindle Paperwhite Kids (2024) deals\nAmazon also rolled out a Kindle Paperwhite Kids for $179.99 in 2024. It’s identical to the standard Kindle Paperwhite, with the same waterproof design and sharp, seven-inch display. However, like the Kindle Kids, the e-reader is free of ads and offers parental controls you can turn off. It also comes bundled with a kid-friendly cover, a two-year extended replacement guarantee, and six months of Amazon Kids Plus.\nThe latest Kindle Paperwhite Kids normally runs for $179.99, but it’s currently on sale for $139.99 ($40 0ff), its lowest price to date, at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target.\nThe best Kindle Scribe (2024) deals\nLike its predecessor, the second-gen Kindle Scribe is Amazon’s biggest e-reader. It packs a 10.2-inch display with 300ppi resolution, along with the same great battery life for which Kindles are known. What separates the Scribe from other Kindles, however, is that it comes with a stylus, which can be used to jot down notes or doodle in the ebook reader’s built-in notebook. With the latest Scribe, Amazon also introduced a new Active Canvas feature, so you can scribble notes directly on ebook pages, as well as a suite of AI-powered features that can summarize your notes and refine your handwriting.\nRight now, there are no discounts available on the standalone entry-level Kindle Scribe, though Amazon is offering a $40 discount when you purchase two. That said, you can save money on a single unit if you purchase the base Scribe as a part of a bundle with a 9W power adapter, a Premium Pen, and either a plant-based leather cover starting at $434.97 ($55 off) or a premium leather cover starting at $459.97 ($60 off). Alternatively, the 64GB version is available with the same accessories and a premium leather cover for $504.97 ($65 off).\nRead our Kindle Scribe (2024) review.\nThe best Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition deals\nIn October, Amazon announced its first color e-reader, the Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition. Like the Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition, it boasts a seven-inch display with a crisp 300ppi resolution, IPX8 water resistance, wireless charging, and 32GB of storage. However, unlike the Paperwhite, the e-reader offers a color mode, which cuts the resolution in half. Thankfully, it’s still vibrant for a color E-Ink screen despite the lower resolution, rendering it particularly ideal for reading comic books and manga.\nIn the past, we’ve seen the Kindle Colorsoft drop to as low as $224.99 ($55 off), but right now there are no discounts available on the standalone e-reader. That said, you can save some money at Amazon if you buy it as a part of a bundle for $327.97 ($53 off), which nets you a wireless charging dock and plant-based leather cover in black, pink, or green. You can also buy it with a “premium” leather cover in red or black for $349.97 ($35 off).\nRead our Kindle Colorsoft review.","summary":"When it comes to finding a device to read ebooks, you have a few options to choose from.

Each wearable has its own pros and cons, as does the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23369207/apple-watch-se-2022-review-smartwatch\">second-gen Apple Watch SE</a>, but the recent introduction of the new wearables also means there are now more Apple Watch models on the market than ever before — and a lot more deals to be had.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight alignnone\">\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-table-of-contents\"><ol><li><a href=\"#hZHCRf\">The best Apple Watch Series 10 deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#the-best-apple-watch-se-deals\">The best Apple Watch SE deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#zdhvKu\">The best Apple Watch Ultra 2 deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#MpVWgd\">A note on the more premium models</a></li></ol></div>\n</div>\n\n<p>But with all of those options, which one should you pick? Generally speaking, you want to buy the newest watch you can afford so that it continues to receive software updates from Apple. The latest update, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/25/24253366/watch-os-11-apple-watch-smartwatch\">watchOS 11</a>, launched in September on the Series 6 and newer models, ultimately leaving those still using an older Series 4 or 5 behind.</p>\n\n<p>That being said, picking up a watch from the latest (or a recent) generation ensures you’re getting a smartwatch with an updated design, a robust number of features, and plenty of sensors.</p>\n\n<p>Now, let’s get to the deals.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"hZHCRf\">The best Apple Watch Series 10 deals</h2>\n\n<p>The Apple Watch Series 10 represents the latest wearable in Apple’s flagship Series lineup. It features the new S10 SiP chip, faster charging, and a wide-angle OLED display that’s brighter, larger, and easier to read than that of previous models. It weighs half as much as the Ultra, too, and is about 30 percent thinner despite its new 42mm and 46mm sizing. Other upgrades include an added depth and water temperature sensor, as well as a new FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection feature, the latter of which is also available on the last-gen Series 9 and Ultra 2.</p>\n\n<p>While the improvements are certainly welcome, the Series 10 isn’t a vast departure from the prior model, the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23878981/apple-watch-series-9-ultra-2-review-double-tap-precision-finding-siri\">Series 9</a>. That being said, it’s currently on sale at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGJ5KQL7/\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-Watch-Series-10-GPS-42mm-Rose-Gold-Aluminum-Case-with-Light-Blush-Sport-Band-S-M/11385157008\">Walmart</a> right now in the 42mm sizing with GPS starting at $329 ($70 off), which remains its second-best price to date. The 46mm variant, meanwhile, is on sale at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGHQ2QH6/\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-Watch-Series-10-GPS-42mm-Rose-Gold-Aluminum-Case-with-Light-Blush-Sport-Band-S-M/11381354322\">Walmart</a> starting at $359 ($70 off) — which is also the second-best price we’ve seen on the larger configuration — while the LTE models can be had at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGHTCKB1/\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-Watch-Series-10-GPS-Cellular-42mm-Jet-Black-Aluminum-Case-with-Black-Sport-Band-S-M/11402806261\">Walmart</a> starting at $429 ($70 off).</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"D9WbpN\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24246464/apple-watch-series-10-review-smartwatch-wearables\">Read our Apple Watch Series 10 review</a>.</h5>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-best-apple-watch-se-deals\">The best Apple Watch SE deals</h2>\n\n<p>The Apple Watch SE <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/7/23328608/apple-watch-se-new-second-gen-price-specs-features-release-date\">received a refresh in late 2022</a>. It has the same chipset as the Series 8, which is great, but with fewer sensors, no always-on display, and a slightly outdated design compared to the Series 8, Series 9, and Series 10. Those omissions might take this out of the running for some people, but it still may be exactly what you’re after. Best of all, it starts at $249 for the 40mm Wi-Fi / GPS model, which is $30 less than the previous generation’s baseline cost. Opting for cellular connectivity bumps the starting price up to $299 for the 40mm size (44mm adds $20 to each configuration).</p>\n\n<p>Right now, the best deal on the latest Apple Watch SE can be found at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Smartwatch-Starlight-Aluminium-Detection/dp/B0DGJ736JM/\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-Watch-SE-GPS-40mm-Starlight-Aluminum-Case-with-Starlight-Sport-Band-S-M/11451150677\">Walmart</a>, where you can pick the 40mm model with GPS for $189 ($60 off). The 44mm / GPS configuration, meanwhile, is available at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Smartwatch-Starlight-Aluminium-Detection/dp/B0DGHS7R27/\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-Watch-SE-GPS-40mm-Starlight-Aluminum-Case-with-Starlight-Sport-Band-S-M/11430516481\">Walmart</a> for $219 (also $60 off).

The ultra-capable smartwatch has the most features, sensors, and ruggedness of any Apple Watch model available thus far, along with a display that’s 50 percent brighter than the first Ultra. The 49mm smartwatch also packs Apple’s S9 SiP and second-gen ultra wideband chips, just like the Apple Watch Series 9, while maintaining long-lasting battery life, precise GPS tracking, and a bevy of diving-friendly sensors.</p>\n\n<p>In recent months, we saw the Apple Watch Ultra 2 dip to as low as $642 ($157 off) in select configurations. Right now, however, it’s only on sale at Amazon <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGHZ13GG/\">with a Trail Loop</a> or <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGHRFYMM/\">an Ocean Band</a> starting at $729.99 (about $69 off) or with <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGHNX1SH/\">an Alpine Loop</a> starting at $741.89 (about $57 off).

Each wearable has its own pros and cons, as does the second-gen Apple Watch SE, but the recent introduction of the new wearables also means there are now more Apple Watch models on the market than ever before — and a lot more deals to be had.\n \n\nThe best Apple Watch Series 10 deals\nThe best Apple Watch SE deals\nThe best Apple Watch Ultra 2 deals\nA note on the more premium models\n\nBut with all of those options, which one should you pick? Generally speaking, you want to buy the newest watch you can afford so that it continues to receive software updates from Apple. The latest update, watchOS 11, launched in September on the Series 6 and newer models, ultimately leaving those still using an older Series 4 or 5 behind.\nThat being said, picking up a watch from the latest (or a recent) generation ensures you’re getting a smartwatch with an updated design, a robust number of features, and plenty of sensors.\nNow, let’s get to the deals.\nThe best Apple Watch Series 10 deals\nThe Apple Watch Series 10 represents the latest wearable in Apple’s flagship Series lineup. It features the new S10 SiP chip, faster charging, and a wide-angle OLED display that’s brighter, larger, and easier to read than that of previous models. It weighs half as much as the Ultra, too, and is about 30 percent thinner despite its new 42mm and 46mm sizing. Other upgrades include an added depth and water temperature sensor, as well as a new FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection feature, the latter of which is also available on the last-gen Series 9 and Ultra 2.\nWhile the improvements are certainly welcome, the Series 10 isn’t a vast departure from the prior model, the Series 9. That being said, it’s currently on sale at Amazon and Walmart right now in the 42mm sizing with GPS starting at $329 ($70 off), which remains its second-best price to date. The 46mm variant, meanwhile, is on sale at Amazon and Walmart starting at $359 ($70 off) — which is also the second-best price we’ve seen on the larger configuration — while the LTE models can be had at Amazon and Walmart starting at $429 ($70 off).\nRead our Apple Watch Series 10 review.\nThe best Apple Watch SE deals\nThe Apple Watch SE received a refresh in late 2022. It has the same chipset as the Series 8, which is great, but with fewer sensors, no always-on display, and a slightly outdated design compared to the Series 8, Series 9, and Series 10. Those omissions might take this out of the running for some people, but it still may be exactly what you’re after. Best of all, it starts at $249 for the 40mm Wi-Fi / GPS model, which is $30 less than the previous generation’s baseline cost. Opting for cellular connectivity bumps the starting price up to $299 for the 40mm size (44mm adds $20 to each configuration).\nRight now, the best deal on the latest Apple Watch SE can be found at Amazon and Walmart, where you can pick the 40mm model with GPS for $189 ($60 off). The 44mm / GPS configuration, meanwhile, is available at Amazon and Walmart for $219 (also $60 off). If you want the LTE configuration, the 44mm model is currently on sale at Walmart starting at $199 ($130 off), or in the smaller 40mm sizing at Amazon and Walmart starting at $239 ($60 off).\nRead our Apple Watch SE (second-gen) review.\nThe best Apple Watch Ultra 2 deals\nThe latest Apple Watch Ultra launched at $799 in September with GPS and LTE support, much like the original model. The ultra-capable smartwatch has the most features, sensors, and ruggedness of any Apple Watch model available thus far, along with a display that’s 50 percent brighter than the first Ultra. The 49mm smartwatch also packs Apple’s S9 SiP and second-gen ultra wideband chips, just like the Apple Watch Series 9, while maintaining long-lasting battery life, precise GPS tracking, and a bevy of diving-friendly sensors.\nIn recent months, we saw the Apple Watch Ultra 2 dip to as low as $642 ($157 off) in select configurations. Right now, however, it’s only on sale at Amazon with a Trail Loop or an Ocean Band starting at $729.99 (about $69 off) or with an Alpine Loop starting at $741.89 (about $57 off). You can also pick it up at Best Buy and Target in various configurations, though only for its full retail price of $799.\nRead our Apple Watch Ultra 2 review.\nA note on the more premium models\nWhile all of the Apple Watch models and colorways covered here are encased in aluminum (except the Ultra 2, which has a titanium build), Apple does make a more premium range built out of stainless steel and titanium. These offerings are functionally and aesthetically similar to their aluminum counterparts, with slightly refined colors and finishings — polished for the stainless steel and brushed for the titanium. However, they start at much steeper prices of $699 and above. They, too, can often be found on sale, but they’re never discounted as low as the standard base models, so we don’t include them here.","summary":"In September, Apple launched its latest smartwatch, introducing the Apple Watch Series 10 alongside a black rendition of the Apple Watch Ultra 2.
