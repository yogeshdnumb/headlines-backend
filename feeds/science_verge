To do so, you’ll need to sign in with your Nintendo account and choose which console configuration you prefer (and which accessories). Then, you’ll receive an invitation email when it’s time to buy it, assuming you’ve satisfied several other conditions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As of right now, the reservation process is limited to Nintendo account holders in the US and Canada who are at least 18 years old. Invitations will be valid for 72 hours and will be “prioritized on a first-come, first-served basis,” according to Nintendo; you’ll also need to have purchased a Nintendo Switch Online membership for a minimum of 12 months and have logged 50 hours of gameplay on the original Switch as of April 2nd, 2025, to be eligible. What’s more, you must have opted in to <em>share</em> gameplay data with Nintendo (you can see if you’ve done so <a href=\"https://accounts.nintendo.com/privacy\">in the privacy section</a> when logged into your account).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Once invitations have been sent to account holders who have met these criteria, Nintendo says it will send invitations to “remaining eligible registrants” on a first-come, first-served basis. Unsurprisingly, the invitations will be nontransferable and sent to the email address you used while registering your interest with Nintendo. Console and accessory purchases will be limited to one per eligible account, at least during the initial invitation period, with the first batch of invitations going out on May 8th.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Additional invitations will follow periodically, though Nintendo hasn’t specified details beyond that.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"how-to-preorder-at-best-buy\">How to preorder at Best Buy</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Thankfully, if Nintendo’s strict requirements are an issue, the <a href=\"https://corporate.bestbuy.com/2025/nintendo-switch-2/\">preorder process at Best Buy</a> appears to be far more straightforward. Preorders for the Nintendo Switch 2, games, and accessories will begin on April 9 via the Best Buy app and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://howl.link/ht93emcsr1zhk\">BestBuy.com</a>. What’s more, most stores in the US will open at 12AM ET, 11PM CT, 10PM MT, and 9PM PT on June 5th for preorder pickup, signaling a welcome return to a more old-school, midnight release schedule we last saw prior to the pandemic.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Details are sparse beyond that; however, My Best Buy Plus and Total members can land a $20 certificate for every $150 they spend (up to $100) on Nintendo games and gear, which is a nice perk for members of Best Buy’s premium loyalty program. That privilege will <a href=\"https://howl.link/s9lb2etn5ylqe\">run you at least $49.99 a year</a>, though both membership tiers will also grant you access to exclusive discounts, free two-day shipping, and other perks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We expect Best Buy to provide some more preorder information ahead of April 9th — including details on whether the retailer intends to implement a queue system, as it did with the PlayStation 5 release.
