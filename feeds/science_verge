On top of gargantuan battery, the company has managed to cram in other amenities like a projector.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Originally announced at CES 2025, Oukitel is making the WP100 Titan available through a <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1006830823/oukitel-wp100-titan-33000mah-rugged-phone-with-projector\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1006830823/oukitel-wp100-titan-33000mah-rugged-phone-with-projector\">Kickstarter campaign</a> that has already surpassed its modest $10,000 funding goal. The earliest backers can preorder the WP100 Titan for $599, discounted from its $899 retail pricing. Oukitel expects to ship the device as early as April 2025. There’s always some level of risk when backing crowdfunded products, but the company says it’s ready to start mass production in March, and has already shipped <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/pro/this-swiss-army-knife-of-rugged-phones-has-the-largest-battery-ive-seen-on-a-mobile-device-and-the-built-in-projector-is-cool-too\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.techradar.com/pro/this-swiss-army-knife-of-rugged-phones-has-the-largest-battery-ive-seen-on-a-mobile-device-and-the-built-in-projector-is-cool-too\">review units</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Powered by a 2.5GHz MediaTek Dimensity 7300 processor paired with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage, Oukitel says the Titan’s massive battery can let you talk on the phone for up to 289 hours or watch 49 hours of video on its 6.8-inch, 120Hz display.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/oukitel_wp100_titan2.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.703897614892,100,78.592204770215\" alt=\"Two Oukitel WP100 Titan smartphones.

It’s limited to just 100 lumens, which means you’ll need a very dark space to get anywhere close to creating a big screen experience. Oukitel doesn’t specify how much of a hit battery life takes while using the projector, but the company says you can watch up to six full-length movies on a full charge.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Titan has an IP68 water resistance rating, meaning it can be submerged in five feet of water for up to 30 minutes and survive a drop from nearly the same height. On the back is a 200-megapixel main camera, a 20-megapixel infrared night vision camera, and a two-megapixel macro camera, while the front features a 32-megapixel selfie camera.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Out of the box Oukitel says the WP100 Titan will run Android 14.

That’s the approach that Oukitel has taken with its new WP100 Titan smartphone. The company is known for creating chunky phones with extended battery life, and its new 1.3-inch thick Titan pushes that even further with a 33,000mAh battery the company says is good for 4,459 hours — or about six months — of standby time. On top of gargantuan battery, the company has managed to cram in other amenities like a projector.\nOriginally announced at CES 2025, Oukitel is making the WP100 Titan available through a Kickstarter campaign that has already surpassed its modest $10,000 funding goal. The earliest backers can preorder the WP100 Titan for $599, discounted from its $899 retail pricing. Oukitel expects to ship the device as early as April 2025. There’s always some level of risk when backing crowdfunded products, but the company says it’s ready to start mass production in March, and has already shipped review units.\nPowered by a 2.5GHz MediaTek Dimensity 7300 processor paired with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage, Oukitel says the Titan’s massive battery can let you talk on the phone for up to 289 hours or watch 49 hours of video on its 6.8-inch, 120Hz display.\nOn the back of the phone is a 1,200-lumen LED camp light that can be used for up to 150 hours — assuming you’re not doing much else with the phone — but its built-in projector isn’t quite as bright. It’s limited to just 100 lumens, which means you’ll need a very dark space to get anywhere close to creating a big screen experience. Oukitel doesn’t specify how much of a hit battery life takes while using the projector, but the company says you can watch up to six full-length movies on a full charge.\nThe Titan has an IP68 water resistance rating, meaning it can be submerged in five feet of water for up to 30 minutes and survive a drop from nearly the same height. On the back is a 200-megapixel main camera, a 20-megapixel infrared night vision camera, and a two-megapixel macro camera, while the front features a 32-megapixel selfie camera.\nOut of the box Oukitel says the WP100 Titan will run Android 14. An “OTA upgrade to Android 15 in the pipe,” the company claims, but it’s not known if the Titan will be updated to Android 16 when Google releases the next version of its mobile OS later this year.","summary":"What if a smartphone maker decided to cram as many features into a device as possible and not worry about maintaining a pocket-friendly design?
