Now, advocates and lawmakers are pressing Meta for answers about how it’ll clean up pollution stemming from the data center’s energy consumption.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), ranking member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, shot off a <a href=\"https://www.epw.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/1/4/142ce027-8201-46f9-a6f9-f9c884cf6fd8/5E5D6F4B0DECC12601BCB5617A973CE29AA5483C86C1B818D2DA914294EE6F90.5.14.25-letter-to-meta-re-data-centers.pdf\">letter</a> to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Wednesday demanding answers about how much energy the data center would use and the greenhouse gas emissions that would be generated. Powering the new data center with gas “flies in the face of Meta’s climate commitments,” the letter says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Tech companies are rushing to build out data centers to train and run new AI tools, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/24/24049047/data-center-ai-crypto-bitcoin-mining-electricity-report-iea\">driving up electricity demand</a>. In this case, power utility Entergy wants to meet that demand with new gas infrastructure, raising concerns about the impact Meta’s data center will have on the environment and local residents.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>“We urgently need corporate responsibility”</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Meta’s backslide from its own climate pledges risks triggering broader economic harm at a time when we urgently need corporate responsibility,” Sen. Whitehouse said in a statement emailed to <em>The Verge</em>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 2020, Meta <a href=\"https://tech.facebook.com/ideas/2020/9/facebooks-path-to-net-zero/\">pledged</a> to reach net-zero emissions across its operations, supply chain, and consumer use of its products by the end of the decade. But the company’s carbon footprint is larger now than it was when it set that goal, according to its latest <a href=\"https://sustainability.atmeta.com/2024-sustainability-report/\">sustainability report</a>, as it <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/657645/meta-ai-app-chatgpt-competitor-release-ios-android\">doubles down on AI</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The company has tried to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/28/24230481/meta-sustainability-report-carbon-footprint-renewable-energy-climate-change\">reduce its emissions by matching its electricity use with equal purchases of renewable energy.</a> It’s a strategy Meta and other big companies often take: pay to support new clean energy projects to try to cancel out the environmental effects of your facilities plugging into a power grid that runs on dirty energy. Environmental advocates are increasingly concerned that this strategy still burdens communities with local pollution, and that the pressure to meet rising electricity demand from AI is boosting fossil fuel use rather than renewable energy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We’re seeing that tussle play out in Richland Parish, Louisiana, where Meta has plans to build its largest data center to date. It’s <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/RichlandParishDataCenter/posts/pfbid02xNEFmJf9bLAi26v6dr3WtW1e7aec8Gn5yow2Zi2sdENXQJXQLbsdMwtLbZ5ZcEETl\">spending $10 billion on the project</a>, the company <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/meta-selects-northeast-louisiana-as-site-of-10-billion-artificial-intelligence-optimized-data-center-that-will-be-companys-largest-in-the-world-302322851.html\">announced</a> in December. Once complete, the campus would span 4 million square feet, about as large as <a href=\"https://www.ucs.org/about/news/entergy-gas-plant-data-center-proposal-bad-louisianans\">70 football fields</a>. But the project is moot unless Meta can ensure there will be enough electricity available for all those servers, a problem it’s working with Entergy to solve. Entergy <a href=\"https://www.entergynewsroom.com/news/entergy-louisiana-power-meta-s-data-center-in-richland-parish/\">proposed building three entirely new gas plants</a> with a total capacity of 2,260 megawatts to support the data center, but it has to get regulatory approval first.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some advocates contend that there hasn’t been enough transparency around Meta’s data center plans to help the public understand the potential impact on the local power grid. The New Orleans-based Alliance for Affordable Energy and the Union of Concerned Scientists <a href=\"https://lailluminator.com/2025/03/07/meta-power-plans/\">filed</a> a <a href=\"https://ucs-documents.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/clean-energy/ELL-Data-Center-Case-Joinder-Motion-Final-3-4-25.pdf\">motion</a> in March asking the Louisiana Public Service Commission to add Meta as an official party to proceedings over whether to approve construction of the new gas plants. Doing so would compel the company to disclose more information, and the commission is scheduled to consider the motion on Monday.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It&#8217;s hard to wrap your brain around [whether] a facility like this either might be good for your community or bad for your community without understanding the possible impact to your electrical system, your bills, and your water,” says Logan Burke, executive director of the Alliance for Affordable Energy. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are already <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/business/energy-environment/data-centers-utilities-electricity-bills.html\">forecasts that rapidly growing data center electricity demand could raise electricity bills</a> in the US. Meta said in December that it would contribute $1 million a year to an Entergy <a href=\"https://www.entergy.com/care/\">program</a> that helps older adults and people with disabilities afford their bills. Data centers have also been notorious <a href=\"https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2023/04/28/ai-programs-consume-large-volumes-scarce-water\">water-guzzlers</a>, although Meta says it would invest in projects to restore more water than it would consume.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Sen. Whitehouse’s letter, meanwhile, asks Meta to answer a list of questions by May 28th. On top of questions about the data center’s electricity use and greenhouse gas emissions, Whitehouse wants to know what the justification is for building gas-fired power plants rather than renewable energy alternatives. And it presses Meta to explain how the proposal aligns with its 2030 climate goal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Meta maintains that it’ll continue matching its electricity use with support for renewable energy, including a commitment to help fund 1,500 megawatts of new solar and battery resources in Louisiana. It also said it would help fund the cost of adding technology to at least one power plant that would capture carbon dioxide emissions. Whitehouse wants to know how much funding it will provide and how much carbon will be captured.

Now, advocates and lawmakers are pressing Meta for answers about how it’ll clean up pollution stemming from the data center’s energy consumption.\nSen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), ranking member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, shot off a letter to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Wednesday demanding answers about how much energy the data center would use and the greenhouse gas emissions that would be generated. Powering the new data center with gas “flies in the face of Meta’s climate commitments,” the letter says.\nTech companies are rushing to build out data centers to train and run new AI tools, driving up electricity demand. In this case, power utility Entergy wants to meet that demand with new gas infrastructure, raising concerns about the impact Meta’s data center will have on the environment and local residents.\n\n“We urgently need corporate responsibility”\n\n\n“Meta’s backslide from its own climate pledges risks triggering broader economic harm at a time when we urgently need corporate responsibility,” Sen. Whitehouse said in a statement emailed to The Verge.\nIn 2020, Meta pledged to reach net-zero emissions across its operations, supply chain, and consumer use of its products by the end of the decade. But the company’s carbon footprint is larger now than it was when it set that goal, according to its latest sustainability report, as it doubles down on AI. \nThe company has tried to reduce its emissions by matching its electricity use with equal purchases of renewable energy. It’s a strategy Meta and other big companies often take: pay to support new clean energy projects to try to cancel out the environmental effects of your facilities plugging into a power grid that runs on dirty energy. Environmental advocates are increasingly concerned that this strategy still burdens communities with local pollution, and that the pressure to meet rising electricity demand from AI is boosting fossil fuel use rather than renewable energy. \nWe’re seeing that tussle play out in Richland Parish, Louisiana, where Meta has plans to build its largest data center to date. It’s spending $10 billion on the project, the company announced in December. Once complete, the campus would span 4 million square feet, about as large as 70 football fields. But the project is moot unless Meta can ensure there will be enough electricity available for all those servers, a problem it’s working with Entergy to solve. Entergy proposed building three entirely new gas plants with a total capacity of 2,260 megawatts to support the data center, but it has to get regulatory approval first.\nSome advocates contend that there hasn’t been enough transparency around Meta’s data center plans to help the public understand the potential impact on the local power grid. The New Orleans-based Alliance for Affordable Energy and the Union of Concerned Scientists filed a motion in March asking the Louisiana Public Service Commission to add Meta as an official party to proceedings over whether to approve construction of the new gas plants. Doing so would compel the company to disclose more information, and the commission is scheduled to consider the motion on Monday. \n“It’s hard to wrap your brain around [whether] a facility like this either might be good for your community or bad for your community without understanding the possible impact to your electrical system, your bills, and your water,” says Logan Burke, executive director of the Alliance for Affordable Energy. \nThere are already forecasts that rapidly growing data center electricity demand could raise electricity bills in the US. Meta said in December that it would contribute $1 million a year to an Entergy program that helps older adults and people with disabilities afford their bills. Data centers have also been notorious water-guzzlers, although Meta says it would invest in projects to restore more water than it would consume.\nSen. Whitehouse’s letter, meanwhile, asks Meta to answer a list of questions by May 28th. On top of questions about the data center’s electricity use and greenhouse gas emissions, Whitehouse wants to know what the justification is for building gas-fired power plants rather than renewable energy alternatives. And it presses Meta to explain how the proposal aligns with its 2030 climate goal.\nMeta maintains that it’ll continue matching its electricity use with support for renewable energy, including a commitment to help fund 1,500 megawatts of new solar and battery resources in Louisiana. It also said it would help fund the cost of adding technology to at least one power plant that would capture carbon dioxide emissions. Whitehouse wants to know how much funding it will provide and how much carbon will be captured. Carbon capture tech has been prohibitively expensive to deploy and costs are often offset by using the captured CO2 to produce more fossil fuels through a process called enhanced oil recovery.\n“We received the letter and look forward to providing a response,” Meta spokesperson Ashley Settle said in an email to The Verge. “We believe a diverse set of energy solutions are necessary to power our AI ambitions – and we continue to explore innovative technology solutions.”\nEntergy didn’t immediately respond to inquiries from The Verge.
