","summary":"It’s easy to be cynical about the state of the world—even when you’re a researcher who studies empathy and kindness. Stanford University psychologist Jamil Zaki turned his own negativity into his new book Hope for Cynics: The Surprising Science of Human Goodness. The book busts common myths about cynicism and explores what it could be doing to our body and brain. Zaki reflects on the imperfections of cynicism and hope and presents a third option: hopeful skepticism.\n\nRecommended reading:\nRead Hope for Cynics: The Surprising Science of Human Goodness. \nFollow Jamil Zaki’s work at www.jamil-zaki.com and www.ssnl.stanford.edu\n\nE-mail us at sciencequickly@sciam.com if you have any questions, comments or ideas for stories we should cover!\nDiscover something new every day: subscribe to Scientific American and sign up for Today in Science, our daily newsletter. \n\nScience Quickly is produced by Rachel Feltman, Fonda Mwangi, Kelso Harper, Madison Goldberg and Jeff DelViscio.

Pediatric hematologist Angela Weyand, a clinical associate professor at the University of Michigan Medical School in Ann Arbor, points to one population that could be at a higher risk—young women with heavy menstrual bleeding. In one study from a national database, nearly 40 percent of otherwise healthy adolescent women were iron-deficient, and 6 percent were additionally anemic. Awareness and self-advocacy could help people receive accessible and inexpensive treatments for low iron levels.\n\nRecommended reading:\n“Prevalence of Iron Deficiency and Iron-Deficiency Anemia in US Females Aged 12–21 Years, 2003–2020,” by Angela C.

Scientists aren’t sure why humans evolved to sing, but commonalities in traditional music offer clues to how the practice evolved. Neuroscience shows us where speech and singing live in the brain and what information the forms hold. And an upcoming experiment will look into how singing might make us more connected to one another.\nRecommended reading:\nNew Folk Song Analysis Finds Similarities around the World\nHow Artificial Intelligence Helped Write This Award-Winning Song\nE-mail us at sciencequickly@sciam.com if you have any questions, comments or ideas for stories we should cover!\nDiscover something new every day: subscribe to Scientific American and sign up for Today in Science, our daily newsletter.\nScience Quickly is produced by Rachel Feltman, Fonda Mwangi, Kelso Harper, Madison Goldberg and Jeff DelViscio.
